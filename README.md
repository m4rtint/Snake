# Snake
Always wanted to try and make a snake game.
Had an assignment on it in my first year learning how to program, and never completed it.

Jetlag on a Friday night, I wanted to stay awake by making a simple game -> Snake.
Plus the bonus of integrating and enforcing my recently learnt C# coding standard into this project and future Unity Testing.

So I started after work, and ended up with this by the end of Saturday
